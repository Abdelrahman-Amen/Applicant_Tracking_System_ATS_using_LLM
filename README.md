# What is an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)? üíº


An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is a software application used by companies to manage the recruitment process. It automates the hiring workflow by:

‚Ä¢ Screening resumes: The ATS scans resumes for relevant keywords, qualifications, and experiences that match the job description.

‚Ä¢ Organizing candidate information: It sorts and stores resumes for easy access by recruiters.

‚Ä¢ Enhancing recruitment efficiency: ATS systems help hiring managers filter out unqualified candidates quickly and streamline the selection process.

In essence, an ATS serves as a gatekeeper, ensuring only the most qualified candidates make it through to human review.


# How We Create an ATS Using LLM (Large Language Models) ü§ñ


### 1. Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs):

‚Ä¢ LLMs like Google Gemini allow us to evaluate resumes in a more human-like manner by analyzing the content in-depth.

‚Ä¢ They can understand context, intent, and sentiment, making the process of matching resumes with job descriptions more accurate than traditional keyword-based methods.

### 2. Input Analysis:

‚Ä¢ We ask the LLM to analyze both the job description and the resume.

‚Ä¢ The system evaluates key skills, experiences, qualifications, and other relevant attributes present in the job description and matches them with the candidate's resume.



### 3. Generating Meaningful Output:

‚Ä¢ The LLM generates two types of outputs:

‚Ä¢ A detailed analysis: Describing how well the resume fits the job, including strengths and areas for improvement.

‚Ä¢ A percentage match score: Giving an overall compatibility score between the resume and the job description based on the keyword match and overall relevance.



## Streamlit App Breakdown üßë‚Äçüíº : 

### Job Description Input üìù

‚Ä¢ Text Area: The user can input a job description that specifies the role's requirements. This will be compared with the uploaded resume.

### Resume Upload üìÑ

‚Ä¢ File Uploader: The user uploads their resume in PDF format, and the app extracts the content to analyze it.

### Buttons for Actions üîò

‚Ä¢ "Tell Me About the Resume": This button triggers an analysis of how well the resume matches the job description, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement.

‚Ä¢ "Percentage Match": This button calculates the percentage of compatibility between the resume and the job description.


### Key Features:

‚Ä¢ Generative AI Integration: The app uses Google Gemini‚Äôs generative AI to process and evaluate the input text (both resume and job description).

‚Ä¢ Text Extraction from PDF: The PyPDF2 library is used to extract the text from the uploaded PDF resume, making it ready for analysis.

‚Ä¢ Environment Configuration: The app uses environment variables (loaded from .env) to securely store the API key for Google Generative AI.




# How It Works üöÄ:

### 1.Resume and Job Description Processing:

‚Ä¢ The user uploads their resume and provides the job description.

‚Ä¢ The app uses a PDF extractor to grab the text from the resume and then formats it for AI evaluation.

### 2.Prompt Creation:

‚Ä¢ The LLM generates responses based on two main prompts:

‚Ä¢ Tell Me About the Resume: Provides a detailed analysis of how well the resume fits the job description.

‚Ä¢ Percentage Match: Calculates a compatibility score to determine how closely the resume aligns with the job description.

### 3.Result Display:

‚Ä¢ After processing, the app displays the AI-generated results on the interface, offering a detailed evaluation and percentage score.
